#### Execution

***

Clone or download the repo folder, put it over your webserver localhost/VirtualHost folder(as I used XAMPP, the folder is htdocs over its root) and start it. XAMPP download: https://xampp.br.uptodown.com/windows/versions. For information regards VirtualHost you can read it here: https://www.cloudways.com/blog/configure-virtual-host-on-windows-10-for-wordpress/

As i used Windows for all the development, webserver management via other OS's may be set on other applications.
